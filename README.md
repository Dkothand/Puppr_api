# Puppr API

- This is the API for the Puppr app, built for my final project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

## Technologies

- The API was built with Ruby on Rails and connected to a PostgreSQL database

## Initial Design

<img src="../Puppr App Data Model-2019-05-31_16_04.png">

The initial design for the API consisted of 5 models, with relationships between the users account and their personal dogs. The original design was to have a messaging functionality between users, but due to time constraints was not implemented.

## Final Design

After the assigned week, the tables in the user accounts are what is implemented in the API. The Communications tables will have to be built out at a future date.
